# 📝 Modern Blog Template

A responsive, minimal, and modern blog website template built with **pure HTML and CSS**. All images are sourced using external image APIs (like Unsplash), so no assets folder is required. Ideal for personal blogs, articles, or portfolio-style content.



## 📸 Preview

Images are dynamically loaded via API URLs. No local images or `/assets` folder used.

## 🔄 Git Tips

If you get a `non-fast-forward` error while pushing:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

Or, if you're okay with overwriting the remote:

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

> ⚠️ Use force-push carefully. It overwrites remote history.
