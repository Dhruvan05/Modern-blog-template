🔄 Version Control Tips
If you get an error like rejected: non-fast-forward, it means the remote repo has updates your local copy doesn't. Use:

git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main

Or, if you're sure you want to overwrite the remote changes:

git push origin main --force

⚠️ Use force push only when you're certain it's safe (like solo projects).
